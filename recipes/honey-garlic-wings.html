    <h3>
      Honey garlic chicken wings are absolutely delicious. They’re sweet and
      sticky and the perfect addition to any appetizer plate. These chicken
      wings are oven baked until crispy and then coated with a honey garlic
      sauce.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When you order chicken wings at a restaurant, they deep fry them. It’s so
      much better to make chicken wings in the oven at home! Chicken wings in
      the oven come out every bit as crispy and a whole lot less greasy. Plus,
      you don’t have all the oil spatter or cleanup to worry about. Just toss
      the parchment paper and foil when you’re done.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Wings</li>
      <li>honey</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
      <strong>*Optional Ingredients*</strong>
      <li>ginger</li>
      <li>brown sugar</li>
      <li>cornstarch</li>
      <li>sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        After you have separated your wings into flats and drumettes (if
        necessary) pop them in a large bowl! We keep it simple and pat them dry
        with paper towels (don’t skip that step). Then, drizzle with olive oil,
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place them in an even layer on a large baking sheet. Make sure the wings
        aren’t touching if possible so that they don’t stick together. Keep
        clean up easy by lining your baking sheet with parchment paper too!
      </li>
      <li>
        While the wings are in the oven we’re going to make a really simple but
        flavor packed sauce! The sauce is just honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic,
        sesame oil and sesame seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now when the wings come out of the oven use tongs to get them into a
        large clean bowl right away. Toss them with the sauce until every wing
        is nice and coated. These are best served right away.
