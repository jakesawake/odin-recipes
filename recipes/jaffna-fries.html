    <h3>
      Jaffna Fries are a spicy, aromatic twist on classic fries, inspired by the
      bold flavors of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Thinly cut potatoes (or sweet potatoes)
      are coated in a mix of chili, turmeric, cumin, and coriander, then
      deep-fried until crispy. Finished with lime juice and crispy curry leaves,
      they’re a fiery, fragrant snack or side dish—perfect with coconut chutney
      or tamarind sauce. 🌶️🔥 (Think of them as Sri Lankan-style "chili fries"
      with a tangy, herbal kick!)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Crispy potato sticks coated in chili, turmeric, cumin, and rice flour,
      deep-fried, then tossed with lime and curry leaves for a spicy, aromatic
      kick. 🌶️🔥 (5 ingredients, 15 mins – Sri Lanka's answer to loaded fries!)
